SECTION 1: Project Foundation, Theme, and Layout

> Prompt:



Create a full-stack web app for SoulSeer — a spiritual, mystical, and celestial-themed psychic reading platform. Use Vite + React for the frontend and a backend stack compatible with Vercel’s architecture. Implement the following foundational items:

1. Global theme and appearance using a celestial style — color palette includes black, soft pinks, gold accents, and white highlights. Include glow and sparkle effects throughout.
2. Set up role-based login and JWT authentication (reader, client, admin).
3. Set up initial routing using React Router. Each route must be fully connected with a matching page:
   - `/` (Home)
   - `/about`
   - `/readers`
   - `/live`
   - `/shop`
   - `/community`
   - `/messages`
   - `/dashboard` (dynamically load reader, client, or admin dashboard based on role)
   - `/help`
   - `/policies`
   - `/register`
   - `/login`
   - `/logout`
   - `/apply`

Add a persistent top navigation bar with logo placeholder, and footer. Pages should use reusable layout components styled to match the SoulSeer theme.

SECTION 2: Auth, User Roles, and Onboarding Pages

> Prompt:



Build out the authentication system with user role management:

1. Implement secure signup and login pages using JWT. Store user sessions in localStorage.
2. Signup form must capture:
   - Full name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Role (client or reader)
3. Automatically assign new users to the selected role.
4. Build an `/apply` page for potential readers with:
   - Full name
   - Bio
   - Photo upload
   - Schedule availability input
   - Psychic specialties (checkbox or tags)
   - Submit button

Connect all forms to the backend and store user data in MongoDB. Redirect to dashboards after login based on role.

SECTION 3: Reader, Client, and Admin Dashboards
Prompt:
Create dynamic dashboards at `/dashboard`, with layouts based on the authenticated user’s role.

1. **Reader Dashboard**  
   - Editable profile: bio, profile picture, specialties, and session rates (per-minute for chat, phone, video)  
   - Availability scheduler for live/on-demand and scheduled sessions  
   - View earnings and session history  
   - Toggle for choosing free or paid replies to client messages  
   - Connect to Square for payouts (use Square OAuth and API for linked accounts)  

2. **Client Dashboard**  
   - View and top-up account balance via Square Checkout  
   - Favorite readers list  
   - Session history (on-demand and scheduled)  
   - Booking system for scheduled sessions  
   - Launch pay-per-minute chat, call, or video sessions if a reader is available  

3. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Manage users (view/edit/suspend reader and client accounts)  
   - Review reader applications  
   - Monitor platform activity: sessions, revenue, flagged content  
   - Admin-only ability to override reader rates or payout issues  

All dashboards must be styled to match the SoulSeer mystical and ethereal theme, with glowing cards, celestial UI, and smooth transitions.


SECTION 4: Messaging vs. Pay-Per-Minute Chat (Clear Distinction)
Prompt:
Implement two separate systems:

1. **Messages** (Free + Optional Paid Reply)  
   - Located at `/messages`  
   - Clients can always send messages to readers for free  
   - Readers can choose whether their reply is free or paid, per message  
   - If paid, the system deducts the message fee from client balance and logs it in reader earnings  
   - Include message history, timestamps, and visual markers for paid replies  

2. **Pay-Per-Minute Chat / Phone / Video System (RTC)**  
   - On-demand system where clients connect live with readers  
   - Reader sets a per-minute rate  
   - Client must have sufficient balance to begin  
   - Timer starts once session begins; deduct balance per minute  
   - Reader earns 70% of each minute charged  
   - End session automatically when balance runs out  
   - Include session logs in both dashboards  

Use a free-tier RTC provider with chat, voice, and video SDK. Tie billing logic directly into Square APIs for all payments, session tracking, and payouts.


SECTION 5: Scheduling System (Standalone, One-Time Payments)
Prompt:
Create a separate **scheduled reading system** from the on-demand system:

1. Readers set monthly availability on a calendar (time slot picker)  
2. Clients browse readers, choose a time, select session type (chat, phone, video)  
3. Clients pay a one-time flat fee via Square Checkout when booking  
4. Scheduled sessions show up in both dashboards  
5. On the scheduled date/time, allow the client and reader to start a session from their dashboard  
6. Reader earnings logged after the session completes  
7. Session duration and type are logged  

Use Square for all booking payments and payout management. Avoid mixing this with the on-demand (pay-per-minute) system.


SECTION 6: SoulSeer Shop (Square Checkout Only)
Prompt:
Build the SoulSeer shop system:

1. `/shop` page displaying spiritual/metaphysical items  
   - Product image, name, price, description  
   - Add to cart functionality  

2. Cart + Square Checkout integration (no Stripe)  
3. Admin dashboard: add/edit/delete products  
4. Clients see purchase history in their dashboard  

Style the entire shop with SoulSeer’s celestial design — floating product cards, sparkles, and gold accents.


SECTION 7: Community Forum (Threaded + Highlights)
Prompt:
Create a rich `/community` forum page with:

1. Threaded discussion system (forums with nested replies)  
   - Users can create new threads or reply to existing ones  
   - Readers and clients can both post  
   - Show thread title, description, tags, author info  

2. Top of the page must feature two glowing cards:
   - **Join Our Discord**: link to SoulSeer’s Discord server
   - **Support Us on Patreon**: link to SoulSeer’s Patreon page  

3. Add categories for intuitive browsing (e.g., Psychic Talk, Spiritual Healing, Events)

Use soft pinks, black, white, gold sparkles, and celestial background graphics. Highlight popular threads visually.


SECTION 8: Livestream + Gifting with Square Integration
Prompt:
Build a `/live` livestream page where readers can go live and clients can join:

1. Reader livestream using Mux or similar SDK  
2. Clients can send virtual gifts during the stream (hearts, stars, crystals)  
3. Each gift costs a set amount of credits (from balance)  
4. Gifts display as animated overlays and are added to reader’s Square earnings  
5. Show livestream schedule and who's currently live  

Use Square APIs for:
   - Deducting balance for gifts  
   - Logging reader earnings  
   - Managing payout thresholds  

Add a dreamy glowing stream layout with gift animations and spark effects.


SECTION 9: Final Touches, Error Handling, and Theming
Prompt:
Complete the following for final polish:

1. `/help` – FAQs, embedded chat (PureChat), and support form  
2. `/policies` – Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy  
3. `/logout` – Clear token and redirect to homepage  
4. Global error handling (missing pages, failed payments, broken RTC)  
5. Page transitions with soft fades, glows, and sparkles  
6. Mobile-first responsive design  

Apply global theming to match SoulSeer — celestial typography, floaty transitions, and soft neon glow effects.
